# Mahjong Game
This is the first project I ever did with C++ for my Programming Fundamentals course. 
The goal of the game is to delete every chip on the board by selecting matching pairs on each turn. For the purposes of the program, the board is displayed as a 8x5 matrix and the chips are displayed as a letter from A - J. A number in parenthesis is shown before the chip that indicates the chip index. 
- A chip can be selected if it has nothing either on its left or right side. 
- To select a chip, enter the number shown in the parenthesis.
- On each turn the board will be refreshed, if the pair matches the chips will be deleted or it will stay the same if they don't. 
- The game ends when there are no more chips left on the board.
